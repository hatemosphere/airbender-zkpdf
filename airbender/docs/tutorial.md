# RISC-V Prover - Tutorial

## What Are We Proving?

We are proving the execution of binaries containing RISC-V instructions with two key features:

* **CSR (Control and Status Registers):** Used for handling input/output operations.
* **Custom Circuits (Delegations):** Special CRSs are used for custom computations, such as hashing.

### Computation Results

By convention, the final results of the computation should be stored in registers 10..18.
For a simple example, see `examples/basic_fibonacci`.

### Inputs and Outputs

Most programs require reading external data. This is done via a special CSR register (0x7c0):

* **Reading Data:** The register can fetch the next word of input into the program. See the `read_csr_word` function in `examples/dynamic_fibonacci` for details.
* **Writing Data:** While this register can also write output, this feature is not used during proving (it's used during the "forward running" of ZKsync OS, a separate topic).

Example: `examples/dynamic_fibonacci` demonstrates reading input (n) and computing the n-th Fibonacci number.

### Delegations (Custom Circuits)
Custom circuits are triggered using dedicated CSR IDs. Currently, only the Blake circuit is supported.


**How It Works:**

Each circuit has a CSR ID (e.g., Blake uses `0x7c2`).

A memory pointer is passed to the circuit for input/output, formatted in the expected ABI.

**Example:** See `examples/hashed_fibonacci`, specifically the `crs_trigger_delegation` method, which computes the n-th Fibonacci number and returns part of its hash.

## How Proving Works

### First Run: Generating Proofs
To start proving:

* Prepare the binary and input file (read via the CSR register).
* Run the first phase of proving using tools/cli prove. This will produce:
  * RISC-V proofs (one for every ~1M steps).
  * Delegate proofs (e.g., Blake, for every batch of calls).

Each proof is a FRI proof that can be verified:

* `Individually:` Use the `verify` command.
* `In Bulk:` Use the `verify-all` command.

### Second Run: Recursion
In this phase:

* The verification code (from above) is compiled into RISC-V and itself proven recursively.
* This process reduces the number of proofs.
    * Current reduction ratio: ~2.5:4 (~half as many proofs).
* After several iterations, only a few proofs remain. These can be verified by other systems (e.g., Boojum) and sent to Layer 1 (L1).


## Getting Started
Try it yourself by following `.github/workflow/ci.yaml`.
Alternatively, run `./recursion.sh` to test 3 levels of recursion.


## Technical Details

### Machine Types
There are two machine types:

* Standard: Full set of instructions.
* Reduced: Subset of operations, optimized for faster verification.

Currently, we use Reduced machines only for verification since they require fewer iterations.

### Checking recursion correctness

At the base level, the user program being proven outputs its result into **8 registers**.

In the verification layers, **16 registers** are returned, where:

* The first 8 registers mirror the user program's return values.
* The last 8 registers contain a hash representing a chain of verification keys. This chain is computed as:

 `blake(blake(blake(0 || user_program_verification_key)|| verifier_0_verification_key) || verifier_1_verification_key)...`

**Optimization**

If the verifier's verification keys remain the same across layers, no new elements are added to the chain in subsequent layers.


**Verification Key Computation**
The verification key for the program is calculated as:

`blake(PC || setup_caps)`

where:
* **PC:** The program counter value at the end of execution.
* **setup_caps:** A Merkle tree derived from the program.
