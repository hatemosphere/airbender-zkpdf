# Repo Layout

What follows is a very rough and partly incomplete layout of our repo. What is NOT present in this repo is our "kernel" ZKsync OS which runs on top of the RiscV cpu, and is found in another repo.

## Prover Implementations
- cpu:
    - circuit_defs/
        - trace_and_split/ - primary code to perform division of complex prover workload into batches
    - prover/
        - prover_stages/ - contains all prover stages for a stark iop batch, stages 1-5 all feed into each other and output a final proof
        - merkle_trees/ - code optimised to perform merkle trees with trimmed tree root nodes and leaf packing of polynomials with shared columns
        - tracers/ - helper code for supporting witness gen of memory argument
        - witness_evaluator/ - code to help evaluate our special witness generation closures
- gpu: 
    - gpu_prover/ - rather comprehensive mix of cuda and rust glue code, to mirror our cpu prover
    - gpu_witness_eval_generator/ - code to help evaluate our special witness generation closures

## AIR Circuits
- cs/
    - cs/ - basic AIR polynopmial apis used everywhere to compose our circuits in a programmatic manner (similar to using a custom DSL). `circuit.rs` trait and `cs_reference.rs` trait impl. are at the heart of all our circuits
    - definitions/ - AIR api extensions
    - delegation/ - custom precompile circuits and their abis (Blake, U256 BigInt)
    - devices/ - AIR api extensions, mostly for constraints that are orthogonally shared between branching opcodes. `optimization_context.rs` contains the bulk of it
    - machine/
        - decoder/ - circuit for the decoding operation of a RiscV cycle, it's called by machine configurations
        - machine_configurations/ - the starting point for all our RiscV circuits, contained in five configurations which all crash when a trap occurs: a normal full isa, a full isa which allows for delegation (default for main proving), a full isa which allows for delegation but is optimised to exclude signed multiplication and division, a minimal isa for the recursion verifier program, a minimal isa that supports delegation (default for recursive verifier proving)
        - ops/ - the circuits to implement each orthogonally branching opcode, they are then called by machine configurations to compose a full RiscV circuit
    - one_row_compiler/ - a layout compiler that converts our Rust AIR constraints into proper witness trace matrices
    - csr_properties.rs - code that contains the definition of our CSRRW lookup table (used for Delegation and long-term memory storage access)
    - trables.rs - code that contains the definition of almost all our lookup tables
    - *.json - files used to serialise parameters and circuit information for the gpu

## Testcases
- circuit_defs/
    - opcode_tests/ - code that embeds the entirety of the standard official RiscV testcases and runs them through our circuits, to provide a basic foundation for safety and consistency

most of the circuits are also hand audited by multiple members of the crypto team. we also have realistic and complex testcases which simulate real proving scenarios and complex bytecode, providing an even more complete testing surface. sometimes we employ SMT solver scripts to validate our optimisations.

Testing the prover itself is of course not required, due to the nature of Zero-Knowledge proofs, since it is sufficient to ensure that the verifier and the circuits are secure.
