### How to use

- compile your circuit and dump to file as in https://github.com/matter-labs/air_compiler/blob/8d357a3756587dfda312dba5efb106e3a3205ea1/prover/src/tests/mod.rs#L410
- use tests in https://github.com/matter-labs/air_compiler/tree/av_one_row_compiler/verifier_generator to generate two files and copy them here
- can run test that reads a proof and simulates feeding the data through CSR register
